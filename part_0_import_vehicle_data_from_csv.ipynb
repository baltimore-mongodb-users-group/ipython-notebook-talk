      "The focus of this talk is to demonstrate reading data directly from Mongo, which of course requires having some data in a Mongo database. We'll be using [data from fueleconomy.gov][1]. I simply downloaded the [ZIP file of vehicle data in CSV format][2] and unzipped it into the same folder as this notebook file. You may want to refer to the [documentation for the vehicle data][3].\n",

      "To run this yourself, just do the following:\n",

      "1.  Make sure you have `vehicles.csv` in the same directory as this notebook.  You'll need to un-gzip it using:\n",
      "    <pre>gunzip -c vehicles.csv.gz > vehicles.csv</pre>\n",
      "    (On Windows, use [7-Zip][4].)\n",
