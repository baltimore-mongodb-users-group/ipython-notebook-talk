# iPython Notebook Talk #

<i>Originally presented November 5, 2013</i>

This project contains the materials from the talk, which is simply three iPython notebooks and a compressed version of the CSV data file used. If you want to view the notebooks without actually installing iPython Notebook, you can use these links:

* [Part 0: Importing Vehicle Data to Mongo from a CSV File][part0]
* [Part 1: Basic Plotting][part1]
* [Part 2: Fancy Plotting][part2]

[part0]: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/baltimore-mongodb-users-group/ipython-notebook-talk/master/part_0_import_vehicle_data_from_csv.ipynb
[part1]: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/baltimore-mongodb-users-group/ipython-notebook-talk/master/part_1_basic_plotting.ipynb
[part2]: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/baltimore-mongodb-users-group/ipython-notebook-talk/master/part_2_fancy_plotting.ipynb

One part of the talk that's not in this repository is the brief off-the-cuff introduction to iPython Notebook that we did at the beginning. You can get pretty much the same information by heading over to the [iPython Notebook home page][ipynb homepage], though.

For the talk, I used (essentially) the following commands to start iPython Notebook:

    cd where/the/notebooks/live
    ipython notebook --matplotlib=inline
