# iPython Notebook Talk #

<i>Originally presented November 5, 2013</i>

This project contains the materials from the talk, which is simply three iPython notebooks and a compressed version of the CSV data file used.

One part of the talk that's not in this repository is the brief off-the-cuff introduction to iPython Notebook that we did at the beginning. You can get pretty much the same information by heading over to the [iPython Notebook home page][ipynb homepage], though.
